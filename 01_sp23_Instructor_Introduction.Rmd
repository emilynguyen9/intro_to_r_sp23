### **Introduction about Me**


My name is Emily Nguyen. I am a senior at the University of Portland, double majoring in Accounting and OTM. I have a job lined up at a accounting firm starting in October that I am excited about. I am sure that my OTM skills will be useful for this position. During my free time, I like to volunteer at my church, assisting second grade teachers. I also like to play badminton and watch Korean dramas.

Anyway, I look forward to this class and maybe after, I can attempt to get into Python too!
